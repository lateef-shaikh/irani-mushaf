# Quran mushaf in Irani style in HTML5

## Proof Read status
This mushaf is still **not proof read**. Please use is cautiously.

## Some background
This repositry uses text from http://moshaf.org/page/IranMoshaf_Arabi therefore I am little bit confident that it'll have less mistakes.

## About this repository
This repository has individual HTML5 files for every soora. Since HTML5 is based on XML therefore these files can be used as an XML source for your API.

## Salient features of this mushaf are:
* Usage of end of ayah (U+06DD) with Arabic numbers
* Usage of small fatha, damma and kasra (U+0618, U+0619 and U+061A) where needed
* Separate tags for ramooz signs within text
* Separate tags for additional information which is normally published in the margins
* Each ayah has attributes for juz, manzil, hizb and hizb quarter numbers
* List of all characters used in this mushaf is located here: https://karachvi.com/quran/charsUsedIrani.html

## Why this Quran text uses Farsi Yeh:
Final shape of Yeh in this Quran style does not have dots (nukta) at the bottom. Therefore I have used Farsi Yeh. However I have kept Alef Maqsura throughout the text wherever it's needed. Here is a video which explains it:
